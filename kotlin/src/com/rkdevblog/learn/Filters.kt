// By default, filter is eager,  each time you use the filter, a list is created
//To make the filter lazy,
// we can use a Sequence, which is a collection that can only look at one item at a time,
// starting at the beginning, and going to the end. Conveniently, this is exactly the API that a lazy filter needs.
